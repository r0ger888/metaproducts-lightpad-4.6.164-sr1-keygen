# Fun fact !
in this app, there was another app label which was LP30 (LP standing for...u know, LightPad) besides the WS40 (which was for Web Studio 4.x), but i "mistakenly" went with this label cuz i was unsure if the app would also take the serial if i concatenate it with that LP label in the pre-RSA string. :m
